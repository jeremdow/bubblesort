# BubbleSort
Implements a bubble sort simulation in Drupal.

This module creates a vector entity that can store an array of integers between 0 and 100, providing view templates which can display each pass when sorting them using a bubble sort algorithm.

The entity is revisionable, so the user may move forward and backward to review the sort.

Default REST endpoints are provided, along with additional routes to step and shuffle (reinitialize) the array.
